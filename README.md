This application is just a demo and also a work in progress, do not use it in a production environment! Feel free to submit any issue you find [here](https://github.com/mig07/PhoneKalendar/issues).

## Run the application

- **Note**: It is required to have Java 11 (LTS) installed.

Open your terminal inside the main folder and run:
```
cd PhoneCalendarApp && ./gradlew build run
```

Or if already inside PhoneCalendarApp/, simply:
```
./gradlew build run
```

## TODO list

This is a sub-section that states on-going implementations and future work.

- On-going implementations:
  - Adapting forms in order to fully utilize the Contact domain model.

- Nice to have implementations:
  - Filtering text inputs with regex;
  - Contact groups;
  - UI improvements: custom css;
